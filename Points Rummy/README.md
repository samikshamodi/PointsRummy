### Rules:
- Rummy is a card game based on making sets.
- From a stash(or hand) of 13 cards, 4 sets must be created (3 sets of 3, 1 set of 4).
- A valid grouping can either be a sequence or a set.
- One set must be a sequence WITHOUT using a joker.
- A SEQUENCE is a group of three or four cards of the same suit.
	For example: 4 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, and 6 of Hearts
- A SET is a group of three or four cards of the same value in different suits.
	For example: 3 of Diamonds, 3 of Spades, 3 of Clubs.
-If you DROP the game, you lose.

### Joker:
- A joker is a card randomly picked from the deck at the start of the game.
- All jokers are considered free cards and can be used to complete sets.
- Printed Joker (PJ): Printed Jokers play the same role in rummy games as wild Jokers. If you get printed Jokers, you can use them to replace any other cards to form sets and sequences. See the groups below and learn how to play the rummy card game with printed Jokers.
Examples
3?-4?-PJ-6?
The PJ has replaced 5? to form a sequence of 3?, 4?, 5?, 6?. It is a valid sequence.
2?-PJ-2?-2?
The PJ has replaced 2? to form a set of 2?, 2?, 2?, 2?. It is a valid set.

Note: If the printed Joker gets randomly selected as the wild Joker, then the aces (Aâ€™s) of all the suits become wild Jokers.

### Types of Sequences:
- There are two types of sequences- Pure Sequence and Impure Sequence.
- A PURE sequence is a group of three or four cards of the same suit formed WITHOUT any joker (printed or wild). 
- An IMPURE sequence is a group of three or more cards of the same suit formed with one or more jokers.

Note: A wild Joker can be used to form a pure sequence if it is used in its original value and as a card of its original suit, not as a Joker.

- During each player's turn, the player may take a card from the pile or a card from the deck to help create sets or sequences.
  Immediately after, the player must drop a card into the pile so as not go over the 14 card limit.
- When a player has created all the sets or sequences, select the declare option.

### How to Win:
When you have arranged all the cards in your hand in proper sequences and/or sets, INCLUDING one pure sequence sequence, you need to declare the game by discarding one of your cards to the Finish Slot. After you have declared the game, you need to arrange your cards in proper sequences and/or sets.

### Valid Declaration:
(i) All 13 cards are arranged in valid sequences and sets.
(ii) It has a minimum of two sequences A?-2?-3?-4? (pure sequence) and 5?, 6?, PJ (sequence). There are at least two sequences, out of which one is a pure sequence. The other cards can be sets or sequences.

### Scoring:
Each card carries a certain number of points. The losing player gets points equal to his/her hand score which is computed as follows :
-J, Q, K, A of any suit carry 10 points each.
-All other numbered cards carry the same points as their face value e.g. 7 carries 7 points and 3 carries 3 points.
-Joker cards carry zero points.
-At the end of the game, a losing player's hand score is computed by adding points for cards that are not grouped as sets/sequences.
-A player can get a maximum of 80 points. For instance, if a player's hand score is 85 he/she will still get only 80 points. But if a player's hand score is 75, he/she will get 75 points.
